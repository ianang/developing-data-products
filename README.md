## We will be using the training dataset from our last machine learning assignment. To explain the dataset, 6 participants were asked to perform 5 ways of doing a dumbbell bicep curl, with 10 repetitions per way. Out of the 5 ways, method A is correct while method B to E represent common mistakes. We will use 5 participants to predict samples from one excluded participant. We will then compare both expected and actual accuracies.
